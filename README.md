- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shubhamoy!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing apps in C++ and python, and also in designing webapps with graphics (openGL, webGL) in javascript, typescript, etc.
- ðŸ‘€ Since you are here, please do check out the webapp that hosts the popular andriod game [Chain Reaction](https://chainserver.pythonanywhere.com).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about AI, and soon going to defend my doctoral thesis on dormancy (see [simulation](https://chainserver.pythonanywhere.com/hiv-dormancy)).
